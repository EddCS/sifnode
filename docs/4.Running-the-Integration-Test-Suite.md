## Running the localnet Integration Test Suite

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker-compose
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
- jq

You can refer to test/integration/setup-linux-environment.sh for the commands
used to install all the necessary tooling in the Ubuntu environment that 
github actions uses.

### Effects

If one has docker and docker-compose installed on their machines,
```./scripts/start-integration-env.sh```
spins up a localnet with ganache-cli, 1 validator node with peggy and run ```./scripts/peggy-basic-test-docker.py```
